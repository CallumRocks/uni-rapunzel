#Rapunzel Project Report

#Design rationale


This interactive web experience is based on the Brothers Grimm Rapunzel story – story that everyone knows from his or her childhood and use modern Retro Futuristic theme. 
Transgender person can face rejection, dis- crimination and often feel alone or feel like being a burden on others. This perception is visualised in our campaign by 
Rapunzel being rejected by her parents and banished into the tower. The question mark in the title is symbolic of gender identity issues. 
We want to convey a feeling of trust for not only young people, but also anyone who needs someone to talk to. 
Built as a one-page site with the purpose of keeping the user immersed without having to click to continue and disrupt the storytelling experience.
The reasoning behind this is the testing done by Signal v Noise that shows that 37.5% more people where signing up on the single page lay- out compared to the same site as a multi-page site. From that study it can be said that users engage better with a single page layout. The site is also more mobile and tablet friendly this way, as scrolling is natural and easy interaction on a touch screen device. The site is made mobile friendly by use of media queries which where used to maximize multi platform usability across all major platforms. 

To allow the story to flow, fade-in and fade-out effects where added to sections of text to reinforce the continuation of the story and make the transition smoother by guiding the line of sight. Other effects to help create a greater storytelling experience include parallax clouds, which move at different rates of speed when scrolling, increasing the engagement; this also adds depth to the site. Along with the parallax effect, using the CSS property z-index allows for elements to stack on top or below other elements adding more depth to the site. 
The site is built around a single fixed element, which is the invitation to scroll. This element is the Rapunzel flower, the purple and yellow flower in the original Grimm Brother tale is the reason she is in the tower; because of this it was chosen as the scrolling element. The flower scrolls with the user until it reaches the arms of the robot to signify the end of the story. The purpose of the site is to promote awareness of the struggle that those with gender identity issues go through, as well as offering support to those people and their families.
The story is separated into three main acts over five sections; the setup (Section 1), the confrontation (Sections 2-4), and the resolution (Section 5). The setup stands out in the site as this is where the story begins and so it is where the eyes are drawn to first. 

By the end of the story the user can continue to the footer section where the user can find links to national support groups and helplines as well as links to share the site to social media like Twitter and Facebook to help boost awareness. 
The website is intended to be memorable, unique, and helpful.
Campaign is going to be launched on 17th of December 2015. Catchy posters will be displayed at bus and train stations and around universities and campuses.
 
#Sources of Insparation
The retelling of the story had to be executed in a Retro Futuristic style. After initial discussion, a few ideas about the look and feel of the website crystallised while others were discounted. It was decided that the drivers for interpretation were going to be Brutalist architecture, Art 
Deco poster art, and reference to the feel and colour scheme of Stanley Kubrick’s ‘A Clockwork orange’ movie creating something that was of its own. 
The tower is one of the most iconic elements of the original Rapunzel tale and we wanted to give this particular attention, drawing together all of the influences mentioned above. The tower was to be the centrepiece of the product and the look and feel of other design elements would evolve organically from the design of the tower. 
This arresting brand of architecture was a perfect starting point for the rationale behind the design of our tower. Intricate and memorable, it would offer scope for an image that would grab attention on bus stops, buses and billboard, as well as on screen. 

#A Clockwork Orange
The look and feel of Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange perfectly illustrates the term Retro Futuristic. There is an interesting use of colour in the film, with monochromatic systems in place, embellished with flashes of colour, giving the film a unique look and feel. The manner in which Kubrick explores the themes of free will and conditioning are also per- tinent to the way we are retelling the story.

#Art Deco posters
At the time, Art Deco was a modernist movement and in the present day it encapsulates the term Retro Futuristic. In the context of our ap- plication, the perspective style of the tower, softened with the curves of the background, coupled with the choice of typeface give it a sug- gestion of Art Deco. Elements in the final design were also influenced by art deco, for example, the rockets and light beams. The colour scheme also echoes this.
